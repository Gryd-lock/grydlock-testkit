Testnet fixtures and score stubs for evaluating Gryd Lock — so the tool can be tested end to end without a live scoring backend.

## Overview

Gryd Lock's warning layer is only useful if it can be measured. This repo provides the labelled inputs and stub scores that make the evaluation in `grydlock-research` actually executable on Stellar testnet.

### The Problem

Gryd Lock decodes transactions, scores destinations, and surfaces a warning tier — but without a known ground truth to check against, there's no way to tell whether a warning is accurate or how often it's wrong. Running the full pipeline against a live scoring backend also makes evaluation slow, non-deterministic, and dependent on infrastructure that may not exist yet.

### What Gryd Lock Testkit Does

At a high level, it does three things:

- **🏷️ Labels** — tags a set of Stellar testnet addresses and assets as `clean`, `suspicious`, or `malicious`, giving the evaluation a known ground truth to score against
- **📝 Stubs** — maps each labelled destination to a deterministic 0–100 score, so scoring can be tested without a live backend
- **🔁 Exercises** — provides sample unsigned transaction XDRs covering common shapes, so the decode step can be run and tested offline

## Features

- **Labelled Destinations**: a set of Stellar testnet addresses and assets tagged `clean`, `suspicious`, or `malicious`, so warnings can be checked against a known ground truth
- **Sample Transactions**: unsigned transaction XDRs covering common shapes (payment, path payment, change trust), used to test the decode step
- **Score Stubs**: a lookup table mapping each labelled destination to a 0–100 score, so the `StubOracle` in [`grydlock-oracle-adapter`](../grydlock-oracle-adapter) can return deterministic results with no network

## Repository Structure

> **Status:** Fixture set being assembled. The layout below describes the target shape.

```
grydlock-testkit/
├── destinations.json     # address / asset → label (clean | suspicious | malicious)
├── scores.json           # destination → 0–100 stub score
├── transactions/         # sample unsigned XDRs for the decode step
└── README.md
```

## How It's Used

- **`grydlock-oracle-adapter`** loads `scores.json` in its `StubOracle` to return scores without a live backend
- **The extension** is pointed at the stub oracle during development, so the full path — decode → score → tier → warning — runs entirely offline
- **`grydlock-research`** runs the extension across every entry in `destinations.json` and measures how often the assigned tier matches the label, producing the accuracy and false-positive numbers

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Fixture Assembly

- [ ] Assemble an initial labelled destination set on testnet
- [ ] Fill `scores.json` so the stub oracle is deterministic
- [ ] Add sample XDRs covering the common Stellar operation types

### Phase 2 — Validation

- [ ] Once a live oracle exists, compare its scores against these stub labels to measure real accuracy

## Gryd Lock Organization

This repo supplies fixtures consumed by other repos in the Gryd Lock project:

| Repo                       | Role                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`grydlock-testkit`** _(this repo)_ | Testnet fixtures, labelled destinations, and score stubs used to test the full pipeline offline |
| **`grydlock-oracle-adapter`** | Loads `scores.json` into a `StubOracle` so scoring can run without a live backend |
| **`grydlock-research`**       | Runs the extension across `destinations.json` and measures warning accuracy against the labels |
